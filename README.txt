One of the most common tasks in image processing is to alter an image’s color. Often this means removing a dominant and undesirable color cast, such as the yellow in photos taken under incandescent illumination. Colour transfer algorithms are used to mood or style an image based on another's image colour pallete. We can imagine many methods for applying the colors of one image to another. Our goal is to do so with a simple algorithm, and our core strategy is to choose a suitable color space and then to apply simple operations there. Here we implement a method for colour transfering, converting the images first to an uncorrelated colour space. This repository includes two images, to be used as a test in order to highlight the effectiveness of the algorithm.

The algorithm is implemented in Matlab.
